	<h1><a name="intr" id="intr">1.</a> Introduction of CloudDrive</h1>
	
	<p>Are you looking for a reliable, convenient and free online storage solution?	CloudDrive is the your choice!&nbsp; 
	CloudDrive is a client software for <a href="https://acrobat.com/">Adobe Acrobat Storage Service</a>, which
	offers 5GB free online storage for each account.So, when you use CloudDrive, all your files are stored in 
	Adobe Acrobat Storage Service.</p>
	
	<p>Why we need such a client software? Cann't I use Acrobat storage service directly?  
	Ok, here is the reason:&nbsp;Adobe Acrobat File Storage Service, like most other online storage solutions, such as Google Docs, Microsoft Skydrive, 
	only offers  you to  upload/download files through their websites. Thinking about uploading a large file or folder, which probably takes hours to finish, 
	in the whole process, you cannot close the webpages or turn off your computer!  There is no way to do the lengthy job silently in backgourd.  
	If this is not too bad? Here is the worst thing: All these services do NOT allow you to upload a folder! 
	Want to upload a folder with hundreds of files/subfolders inside of it? Forget it! It would be a nightmare!   </p>
	
	<p>With CloudDrive, you can upload/download a folder and all the files/subfolders inside of it with just a drag and drop!  
	CloudDrive will take care of all the uploading/downloading in the background.</p>
	
	<p>	With CloudDrive, you do not 
	need to worry anymore about losing your data due to computer hard disk 
	failures or outsider threats. You can be sure your important files 
	will always be there when you need them.</p>
	
	<p>With CloudDrive, you can access to your data from anywhere you are connected to the Internet.</p>
	<br/>
	<h1><a name="guide" id="guide">2.</a> Quick Start Guide</h1>
	
	<h2>2.1&nbsp; Login</h2>
	<p>When you start up CloudDrive,  it will ask you to input your registered email and password on Adobe Acrobat Storage Service  to login.  
	</p>
	<p>If you do not have an account on acrobat.com, click the “sign up” link or visit <a href="https://acrobat.com">Acrobat.com</a>  to sign up for a free account.   
	The sign up page is very simple and friendly. Only your email, password, name and country are required.</p>
	
	<p>After that, your registered mailbox will receive an email from acrobat. You <b>MUST</b> confirm your email by clicking the link in the email.
</p>
	<p>Now input your registered email and password in the login form and start 
	to experience CloudDrive. When the first time you logged in, probably there 
	are already several files in CloudDrive;&nbsp; All of them are Acrobat’s ads, you can delete them all.
</p>

	<h2>2.2&nbsp; Upload files</h2>

	<p>There are 3 ways to upload files or folders: </p>
	<p>a)&nbsp; The most convenient way is:  Drag the uploading&nbsp; files and folders in 
	windows explorer, and drop them in the CloudDrive window. Done!    Is it easy? </p>

	<p>b) Copy&amp;Paste:	Select the files and folders in windows explorer,  right click,  select “copy” in the context menu (or Ctrl+C).  Go back to CloudDrive window, right click, “Paste” (or Ctrl+V).&nbsp; </p>
	<p>c) Click the “upload” button in the toolbar, select files in the popup dialogbox, 
	then click “open” to start uploading.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE:  you can not upload folders through this 
	way.</p>
	
	<h2>2.3&nbsp; Download files</h2>

	<p>  Select files and folders in CloudDrive window, right click, select “Download…”, pick up a folder in the popup dialog, click “OK” to start download.
          </p>
	<p>  NOTE: Drag files/folders from CloudDrive to  windows explorer is not supported yet.  This feature will be included in the future version of CloudDrive.
</p>
	
	<h2>2.4&nbsp; Other functions</h2>

	<p>Double Click a file will start to download the file to local computer and open it.</p>
	<p>Double Click a folder will get into the folder.</p>
	<p>Click the &quot;Parent Folder&quot; button on the toolbar will go back to the upper 
	level folder.</p>
	<p>Delete and Rename are supported.</p>
	<p>......</p>
	
	<h1><a name="faq" id="faq">3.</a> F.A.Q</h1>
	<p id="question">1. Is the online storage free?</p>
	<p>	Yes, Acrobat offers 5GB free storage for each registered account.	</p>
	
	<p id="question">2. Is CloudDrive software free?</p>
	<p>	Yes, this software is completely free. 	</p>

	<p id="question">3. Is it safe to store my files online?</p>
	<p>	Yes. You can trust Adobe Acrobat more than your hard disk. 
	With CloudDrive, all network traffic  are SSL encrypted, so you do not need to worry about data interception. 	</p>

	<p id="question">4.	Is there any limitation for the file to be uploaded?</p>
	<p>	Files larger than 50MB sometime cannot be uploaded successfully, though Acrobat declares there is no problem to upload any file less than 2GB.&nbsp; 
	We will find out the reason and solve the problem in the future version.</p>
	<p>
	Due to the limitation of Acrobat, there are several formats are not supported yet, like MP3 files.  Future version of CloudDrive will support any file format.
	</p>

	<p id="question">5.	5GB storage space is not enough for me, can I have a larger space to store my files?</p>
	<p>	There is a workaround:  you can register more than one account on Acrobat.com, each will have a 5GB free storage apace.  
	So the total space you have is :  5GB * the number of your account.</p>

	<p id="question">6.	Why I can’t download files or folders by drag them from CloudDrive  to my Desktop?</p>
	<p>	Due to some reason,this hasn’t been supported yet.  It will be added in Version 1.0.  </p>

	<p id="question">7.	How can I upload a bunch of files and folders?</p>
	<p>	Drag them from windows explorer and drop them  on CloudDrive.</p>

	<p id="question">8. Is there a requirement for my computer?</p>
	<p>Till now, CloudDrive can only run on windows XP, windows Vista and windows 7.  
	Some mobile platforms will be supported in the future. </p>

	<p id="question">9.	Is there a support service for CloudDrive?</p>
	<p>There is no official support service for CloudDrive, now.
	  However, if you have any suggestion, bug report or problem of using CloudDrive, 
	  please <a href="mailto:jerrywjh@gmail.com?subject=I have a problem using CloudDrive.">email us</a>. We are glad to hear any feedback from our users.  </p>

	<p id="question">10.	Sometime, CloudDrive is not stable, why?</p>
	<p>The current version is 0.68, which means there are still bugs in it.  </p>
	<p>
	Another reason is Acrobat storage service has some yet unknown limitations for  uploading and downloading. It also perform  virus scanning for all uploading files which 
	probably block some requests.   And, the complexity of the Internet and your network environment  can also lead to occasional loss of data.  
	</p>
	<p>We will try to fix all the problems in future verion.  And we are thankful  to hear bug reports from you.
	</p>

	<p id="question">11. How can I get the latest update for CloudDrive?</p>
	<p> You can visit CloudDirve's website: <a href="http://www.driveoncloud.com"> www.driveoncloud.com</a>  to get the latest version.  
	Automatic upgrade will be supported in the future.
	</p>

	<p id="question">12. Does the CloudDrive program quit when I close the CloudDrive window?</p>
	<p>No, when you close the window of CloudDrive, it is minimized to a system tray icon at the bottom-right corner on your desktop and continues to work in background. 
	The only way to quit the program is to right click the system tray icon and select "exit".
	</p>
	<p id="question">13. What features are going to be added  to CloudDrive  in the future?</p>
